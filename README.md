# GD-ProjectAlice
 
A very small WIP prototype for a Slay the Spire inspired roguelike card game. Window settings set at fullscreen 1080 currently.

Quick Start Guide:
1. Download Godotv4.5 version. The project has not been tested with 4.5.1 or the net versions of godot.
2. Import the github files as project through any git application or through godot
3. Once the project has been properly imported, there should simply be an triangle-shaped icon which is the play button located towards the top right of the godot interface.
   - The project should compile and build without any further issues and playable using this button as long as the project has been imported properly
